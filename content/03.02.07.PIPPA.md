#### PIPPA

[PIPPA](https://pippa.psb.ugent.be) is a data management system used for collecting data from the [WIWAM](https://www.wiwam.be/) range of automated high throughput phenotyping platforms. These platforms have been deployed at different research institutes and commercial breeders across Europe in a variety of configurations with different types of equipment such as weighing scales, cameras and environment sensors. Examples are:

+ [Umea Plant Science Centre](https://www.upsc.se/plant-growth-facilities-at-upsc-and-slu-umea/325-upsc-tree-phenotyping-platform.html)
+ [Fondazione Edmund Mach](https://cri.fmach.it/en/Facilities/Technological-Facilities/Plant-Phenotyping#application_fields)
+ [Phenovision](https://www.psb.ugent.be/phenotyping/phenovision)

Developed from 2016 onwards, the software features a web interface with functionality for setting up new experiments for the platform(s), planning imaging and irrigation treatments, linking metadata to pots (genotype, growth media, manual treatments), exporting data, importing data and visualizing data as charts. It also supports the integration of image analysis scripts and connections to a compute cluster for job submission.

To share the phenotype data of the experiments linked to publications, an implementation of BrAPI 1.3 was developed on a separate public PIPPA server open to the public, which allowed read only access to the data in a standardized format. This endpoint was registered on [FAIDARE](https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/faidare/) and allows the data to be found alongside data from other BrAPI endpoints.

As the BrAPI ecosystem has matured, it created a clear path for the development of PIPPA as to how to share data in a manner according to the FAIR principles which are becoming standard in plant research data management best practices. In combination with the support for [MIAPPE](https://www.miappe.org/), these have served as guidelines in the current development, which is focussed on delivering a public BraPI 2.1 endpoint and making more high throughput datasets publicly available via BrAPI.
