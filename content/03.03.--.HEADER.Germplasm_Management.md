### Germplasm Management

The vast quantity of new accessions, variants, and lines being created each year means germplasm data management is critical to keeping things organized. This is true at the level of a single breeding program, on a national scale, and on the international scale. BrAPI supports the transmission of germplasm passport data, as well as pedigree trees and crossing metadata. The BrAPI community has developed BrAPI compliant tools for storing, searching, and visualizing this metadata. There are even some plans in place to build federated networks of genebank data, connected via BrAPI.
