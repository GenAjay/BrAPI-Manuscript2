#### ClimMob

Not all data can be collected by a single person, or even by a single organization. ClimMob is a tool to easily allow citizen scientists to assist in the data collection process. Although this data may not be as detailed as a focused scientific program, it can be very useful to collect simple data from a wide range of locations and environments.

When it comes to BrAPI compatibility, ClimMob follows the same patterns established by Field Book. During a survey, all the farmer collected data is stored in a central ClimMob node. When the survey is complete, all the data is uploaded automatically via BrAPI to a central breeding database for long term storage and analysis.
