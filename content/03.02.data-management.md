#### PHIS 

The Hybrid Phenotyping Information System ([PHIS](http://www.phis.inrae.fr/)[@doi:https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15385]), based on the [OpenSILEX](https://github.com/OpenSILEX/) framework, is an ontology-driven information system based on semantic web technologies. PHIS is deployed in several field and greenhouse platforms of the national [PHENOME](https://www.phenome-emphasis.fr/) and European [EMPHASIS](https://emphasis.plant-phenotyping.eu/) infrastructure. It manages and collects data from Phenotyping and High Throughput Phenotyping experiments on a day to day basis. PHIS unambiguously identifies all the objects and traits in an experiment, and establishes their types and relationships via ontologies and semantics.

PHIS has been designed to be BrAPI-compliant. PHIS adheres to the standards and protocols specified by BrAPI and implements various services aligning with the BrAPI standards, encompassing the Core, Phenotyping, and Germplasm modules. This enables integration and compatibility with BrAPI-compliant systems and platforms. This prerequisite served as the basis for formalizing the data model, while also facilitating compatibility with other standards, such as the Minimal Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment ([MIAPPE](https://www.miappe.org/)[@doi:https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.16544]). By integrating BrAPI requirements into its structure, PHIS not only meets the standards of the phenotyping field, but also strengthens its capacity for interoperability and effective collaboration in the wider context of plant breeding and related fields.

The fact that data within a PHIS instance can be queried through BrAPI services makes the indexing of PHIS in [FAIDARE](https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/faidare/) very easy to implement.

Furthermore, as PHIS offers BrAPI-compliant Web Services, it simplifies the integration and data exchange with other European information systems that handle phenotyping data. The adherence to BrAPI standards ensures a common interface and compatibility, facilitating communication and collaboration between PHIS and other systems in the European context. This interoperability not only eases data sharing, but also promotes a more coherent and efficient approach to the management and use of phenotyping data on various platforms and research initiatives within the European scientific community.

#### DeltaBreed

<!-- Shawn Y.-->
DeltaBreed is an open-source data management system designed and developed by Breeding Insight to support USDA-ARS specialty crop and animal breeders. DeltaBreed is a unified system for managing breeding data that connects a variety of BrAPI applications (see list below). BrAPI integration allows the complexity underlying interoperability to be hidden, shielding users from multifactorial differences between diverse applications. DeltaBreed, adhering to the BrAPI model, establishes data standards and validations for users and provides a singular framework for data management and user training.

DeltaBreed users need not be aware of BrAPI or the specifics of underlying applications but will notice that BrAPI interoperability reduces the need for human-mediated file transfers and data manipulation. Field Book users, for example, can connect to their DeltaBreed program, authenticate, and pull studies and traits directly from DeltaBreed to Field Book on their data collection device. The subsequent step of pushing observations from Field Book to DeltaBreed is straightforward via BrAPI, but will not be implemented until repeated observation handling workflows are established to differentiate and validate repeated observations, such as accidental repeats, overwrite requests, time-series observations, and repeated sub-entity measures. Users can expect DeltaBreed observation handling to become more seamless with future development.

#### BMS


The [Breeding Management System (BMS)](https://bmspro.io), developed by the [Integrated Breeding Platform (IBP)](https://integratedbreeding.net/), is a suite of tools designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of plant breeding. BMS covers all stages of the breeding process, with the emphasis on germplasm management and [ontology](https://cropontology.org)-harmonized phenotyping. It also features analytics and decision-support tools. With its focus on interoperability, BMS integrates smoothly with BrAPI, facilitating easy connections with a broad array of complementary tools and databases, notably [Gigwa](https://southgreen.fr/content/gigwa) which is deployed together with the BMS to fulfill the genotyping data management needs of BMS users.

The [brapi-sync](https://github.com/IntegratedBreedingPlatform/brapi-sync) tool, a significant component of BMS’s BrAPI capabilities, was developed by the IBP and released as a BrAPP for community use. Brapi-sync is designed to enhance collaboration among partner institutes within a network such as Innovation and Plant Breeding in West Africa ([IAVAO](https://www.iavao.org/en)), by enabling the sharing of germplasm and trials across BrAPI-enabled systems. This tool helps overcome traditional barriers to collaboration, ensuring data that was once isolated within specific programs or platforms can now be easily shared, integrated, and synchronized. 

Additionally, brapi-sync improves data management by utilizing the externalReferences field to maintain links to the origin IDs of each entity it transmits. This not only retains the original context of the data but also establishes a traceability mechanism for accurate data source attribution and verification. Such practices are crucial for maintaining data integrity and fostering trust among collaborative partners, ensuring access to accurate, reliable, and current information.



#### Breedbase

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
Since the inception of BrAPI in 2014, the Breedbase group has been a heavy contributor to the BrAPI community.

#### BIMS

BIMS (Breeding Information Management System) [@doi:10.1093/database/baab054] is a free, secure, and online breeding management system which allows breeders to store, manage, archive, and analyze their private breeding program data. BIMS enables individual breeders to have complete control of their own breeding data along with access to tools such as data import/export, data analysis and data archiving for their germplasm, phenotype, genotype, and image data. BIMS is currently implemented in five community databases, the Genome Database for Rosaceae [@doi:10.1093/nar/gky1000], CottonGEN [@doi:10.3390/plants10122805], the Citrus Genome Database, the Pulse Crop Database, and the Genome Database for Vaccinium, as well as a crop-independent website, <https://breedwithbims.org>. BIMS in these five community databases enables individual breeders to import publicly available data so that they can utilize public data in their breeding program. BIMS utilizes the Android App Field Book, enabling seamless data transfer between BIMS and the Field Book App through either files or BrAPI. Data transfer through BrAPI between BIMS and other resources such as BreedBase, GIGWA, and Breeder Genomics Hub is also on the way. 

#### Germinate

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->

[Germinate](https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/get-germinate/) [@doi:10.1002/csc2.20248] is an open-source plant genetic resources database that combines and integrates various kinds of plant breeding data including genotypic data, phenotypic trials data, passport data, images, geographic information and climate data into a single repository. Germinate is tightly linked to the BrAPI specification and supports a majority of BrAPI endpoints for querying, filtering and submission.

Germinate integrates and connects with other BrAPI-enabled tools such as GridScore for phenotypic data collection, Flapjack for genotypic data visualization and Helium for pedigree visualization, but, due to the nature of BrAPI, Germinate can act as a data repository for any BrAPI-compatible tool. Thanks to the interoperability provided by BrAPI the need for manual data handling becomes a rarity with the direct benefit of faster data processing, fewer to no human errors, data security and integrity.

#### MGIS

<!-- authors: Mathieu Rouard, Valentin Guignon -->
The Musa Germplasm information system, [MGIS](https://www.crop-diversity.org/mgis/), serves as a comprehensive community portal dedicated to banana diversity, a crop critical to global food security [@doi:10.1093/database/bax046]. MGIS offers detailed information on banana germplasm, focusing on the collections held by the CGIAR International Banana Genebank (ITC) [@doi:10.1186/s43170-020-00015-6]. It is built on the Build on the Drupal/Tripal technology, like BIMS and Florilège.  Since its inception, MGIS developers have actively participated in the Breeding API (BrAPI) community, pushing for the integration of Multicrop Passport Data (MCPD) into Germplasm module call of the API. MGIS thus provides passport data information on ITC banana genebank accessions (with GLIS DOI), synchronized with [Genesys](https://www.genesys-pgr.org/a/overview/v2YdWZGrZjD), but also enriches it by incorporating additional data from other germplasm collections worldwide. All those germplasm data are available through BrAPI germplasm module calls implementations. For genotyping data, MGIS incorporates GIGWA [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giz051], which provides tailored implementations for BrAPI genotyping module calls. Furthermore, MGIS supports the implementation of a set of BrAPI phenotyping module calls, facilitating the exposing of morphological descriptors and trait information supported by ontologies like the Crop Ontology [@doi:10.1093/aobpla/plq008]. It is integrated with the Trait Selector BrAPP, developed as part of a project involving Breedbase [@doi:10.1093/g3journal/jkac078]. Uses cases between the Musa implementation of Breedbase, MusaBase, and MGIS to interlink genebank and breeding data.
