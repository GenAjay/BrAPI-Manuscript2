#### BrAPIMapper

<!-- Valentin G: I'm planning to add a figure in supplementary data that shows data sets on a side, the mapper with some internal parts and the exposed BrAPI services. -->
BrAPIMapper is a full BrAPI implementation of all calls for any data source missing BrAPI implementation or compliance with some BrAPI versions. BrAPIMapper is provided as a docker application that can get its external data sources from mySQL or PostgreSQL databases (with a dedicated interface for Chado database schema), generic REST services (with a dedicated interface for BrAPI endpoints), flat files (XML, JSON, CSV/TSV/GFF3/VCF, YAML) or any combination of any of those. It provides an administration interface to map BrAPI data models to external data sources. The interface allows administrators to select the BrAPI specification versions to use and the calls to enable. Data mapping configuration export and import features simplify upgrades to future BrAPI specifications changes as administrators would only have to map missing fields or make minor adjustments. Amongst others, it supports paging, search calls, either by providing direct results or using deferred results with a search identifier, lists, authentication and manages access restrictions to calls that can be setup through the administration interface as well. This tool aims to accelerate BrAPI services deployment while ensuring specification compliance.
