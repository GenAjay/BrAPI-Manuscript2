#### Trait Selector BrAPP

<!-- the "BrAPP" description part should better fit at the beginning of the section. -->
BrAPPs are simple tools developed by the BrAPI community that are entirely reliant on BrAPI for their data requirements. This means a single BrAPI can be shared and used by many organizations, as long as those organizations have the standard BrAPI endpoints available.

The Trait Selector BrAPP is used to search and select useful traits, using a visual aid to help the user find exactly what they need. This BrAPP works with both breeding databases and genebanks. Breeding databases would need to only implement the trait, observation and observation variable calls, while genebanks would require trait, germplasm attribute and germplasm attribute value calls. So, BrAPI servers compliant with version 2 implementing any of these sets of calls would just need to follow the documented steps to create an SVG image of a plant of interest in order to use this BrAPP. CassavaBase and MGIS are two successful examples of the use of this BrAPP. (example screenshots coming + supplementary data: links to the git and the doc)
