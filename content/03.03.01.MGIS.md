#### MGIS

<!-- authors: Mathieu Rouard, Valentin Guignon -->
The Musa Germplasm information system, [MGIS](https://www.crop-diversity.org/mgis/), serves as a comprehensive community portal dedicated to banana diversity, a crop critical to global food security [@doi:10.1093/database/bax046]. MGIS offers detailed information on banana germplasm, focusing on the collections held by the CGIAR International Banana Genebank (ITC) [@doi:10.1186/s43170-020-00015-6]. It is built on the Build on the Drupal/Tripal technology, like BIMS and Floril√®ge.  Since its inception, MGIS developers have actively participated in the Breeding API (BrAPI) community, pushing for the integration of Multi-crop Passport Data (MCPD) into Germplasm module call of the API. MGIS thus provides passport data information on ITC banana genebank accessions (with GLIS DOI), synchronized with [Genesys](https://www.genesys-pgr.org/a/overview/v2YdWZGrZjD), but also enriches it by incorporating additional data from other germplasm collections worldwide. All those germplasm data are available through BrAPI germplasm module calls implementations. For genotyping data, MGIS incorporates GIGWA [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giz051], which provides tailored implementations for BrAPI genotyping module calls. Furthermore, MGIS supports the implementation of a set of BrAPI phenotyping module calls, facilitating the exposing of morphological descriptors and trait information supported by ontologies like the Crop Ontology [@doi:10.1093/aobpla/plq008]. It is integrated with the Trait Selector BrAPP, developed as part of a project involving Breedbase [@doi:10.1093/g3journal/jkac078]. Uses cases between the Musa implementation of Breedbase, MusaBase, and MGIS to interlink genebank and breeding data.
