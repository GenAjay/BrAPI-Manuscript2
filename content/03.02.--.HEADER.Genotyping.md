### Genotyping

Genotyping has become a cornerstone of most breeding processes, but the data can be difficult to manage. BrAPI supports genotypic data, relying on some existing standards including VCF and the GA4GH Variants standards. The BrAPI Community has built BrAPI compatible tools for storing, searching, visualizing, and analyzing genotypic data.
