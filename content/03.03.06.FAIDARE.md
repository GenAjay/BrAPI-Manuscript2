#### FAIDARE

<!-- Cyril P, first draft-->
FAIDARE (<https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/faidare/>) is a data discovery portal providing a biologist friendly search system over a global federation of 33 plant research databases. It allows to identify data resources using a full text approach completed with domain specific filters and to link back to the original database for visualization, analysis and download. For instance, it is possible to search for "wheat drought" then to refine the search to the "Triticum aestivum" taxon and yield component traits such as "Thousand Grain Weight". The indexed data types are very broad and include genomic features, such as genes or transposable elements, selected bibliography, QTL, markers, genetic variation studies, phenomic studies and plant genetic resources ie germplasm. This inclusiveness is achieved thanks to a two stage indexation data model. The most generic one provides basic search functionalities and relies on five fields : name, link back URL, data type, species and exhaustive description. The filtering is directly tied to some of those fields. Therefore, to provide more advanced filtering, FAIDARE is also providing a second stage indexation mechanism by taking advantage of BrAPi endpoints to get more detailed metadata on genotyping and phenotyping studies as well as germplasm. In parallel, FAIDARE provides a pre-visualization of germplasm and studies using dedicated cards.

The indexation mechanism relies on a dedicated public software (<https://github.com/elixir-europe/plant-brapi-etl-faidare>) that allows data resources manager to request the indexation of there database using pull requests. This BrAPI client is able to extract data from any BrAPI 1.3 and 1.2 endpoint and development of BrAPI 2.x indexation will be initiated in 2025. Since not all databases are willing to implement BrAPI endpoints, we also provide the possibility to generate metadata as BrAPI json files, hence using the standard as a file exchange format.
FAIDARE architecture has been designed by elaborating on the GnpIS Software Architecture [@doi:10.34133/2019/1671403]. As a consequence, BrAPI is at the core of its data model, and in particular the JSON data files served by the Elasticsearch NoSQL engine are enriched version of the BrAPI JSON files. FAIDARE also includes a BrAPI endpoint that serves all indexed metadata.
FAIDARE has been adopted by several communities and in particular in the ELIXIR and EMPHASIS european infrastructures. It is also used by the WheatIS of the Wheat-Initiative. Several databases are added each year to the FAIDARE global federation, allowing to increase both the portal and the BrAPI adoption.
