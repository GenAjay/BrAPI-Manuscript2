#### ClimMob

Not all data can be collected by a single person, or even by a single organization. ClimMob [@doi:10.1016/j.compag.2023.108539] is a tool to easily allow citizen scientists to assist in the data collection process. Although this data may not be as detailed as a focused scientific program, it can be very useful to collect simple data from a wide range of locations and environments.

When it comes to BrAPI compatibility, ClimMob follows the same patterns established by Field Book. During a survey, all the farmer collected data is stored in a central ClimMob node. When the survey is complete, all the data is uploaded automatically via BrAPI to a central breeding database for long term storage and analysis. This automated process greatly simplifies the data management requirements for ClimMob, with data ready for analysis almost as soon as its done being collected.
