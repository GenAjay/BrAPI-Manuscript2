#### ClimMob

ClimMob [@doi:10.1016/j.compag.2023.108539] is a software suite that turns the research paradigm in experimental agriculture. The platform supports experiment design, data collection through mobile apps, and data analysis to provide actionable insights. Instead of a few researchers designing complicated trials to compare several agricultural technologies in search of the best solutions for the target environment, ClimMob enables many participants to carry out reasonably simple experiments that taken together can offer even more information. It applies the priciples of citizen science and choice experiments to scale the data collection process, mostly in the format of rankings. Although this data may not be as detailed as from a centralized experiment, it can be very useful to inform decisions to a wide range of locations and environments with increased external validity. ClimMob applications include testing crop varieties, evaluating agronomic practices, and investigating climate resilience strategies.

During a crop varieties trial, all farmer-collected data is stored in ClimMob. Upon data collectection completion, the raw data is automatically uploaded via BrAPI to a central breeding database for long-term storage. To facilitate this synchronization, ClimMob uses BrAPI to retrieve curated germplasm information from breeding databases when designing a trial, significantly enhancing data quality. Additionally, a process has been developed to push analyzed data from ClimMob to the breeding databases, providing breeders with insights into the potential adoption of the tested crop varieties.
