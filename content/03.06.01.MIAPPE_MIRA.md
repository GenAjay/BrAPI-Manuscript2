#### MIAPPE ISA to BrAPI service

<!-- Manuel -->
Phenotyping is crucial in the breeding process as it enables the identification of desirable traits, selection of breeding lines, and evaluation of breeding success. In the plant community, MIAPPE (Minimal Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment) [@doi:10.1111/nph.16544] is an established standard for phenotyping experiments. It is commonly serialized as a ISA Tab file type. [@doi:10.1038/ng.1054] Although ISA Tab is easy to read for non-technical experts due to its file-based approach, it lacks programmatic accessability, particularly for web applications. BrAPI, which is aligned with MIAPPE, can help solve this problem.

MIRA is a tool that enables the automatic deployment of a BrAPI server on a MIAPPE-compliant dataset in ISA Tab format. It can be deployed from a Docker image with the dataset mounted. By utilizing the mapping between MIAPPE, ISA, and BrAPI, there is no need for parsing or manual mapping of datasets that are already compliant with (meta-)data standards. By gaining programmatic access through BrAPI to these datasets, it facilitates the integration of phenotyping datasets into web applications.
