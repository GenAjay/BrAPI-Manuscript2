### Phenotyping

Phenotyping is the basis for all breeding efforts. All the downstream analysis and decision making procedures rely on a foundation of accurate, high-quality, phenotypic data. The BrAPI specification supports phenotypic data as it passes through the entire breeding pipeline, as it is published, and as it is archived. The community has developed tools that use BrAPI during the data collection process, to get the data into a standard format as soon as possible. There are BrAPI compatible systems to store and curate phenotypic data, and tools to manage trait meta data. The community has also begun developing BrAPI compatible tools for managing images and other high throughput phenotyping techniques.
