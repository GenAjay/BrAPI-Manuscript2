### Phenotyping

Phenotyping is the basis for all breeding efforts. All the downstream analysis and decision making procedures rely on a foundation of accurate, high-quality, phenotypic data. The BrAPI specification supports phenotypic data as it passes through the entire breeding pipeline, as it is published, and as it is archived. The community has developed tools that use BrAPI during the data collection process, to get the data into a standard format as soon as possible. There are BrAPI compatible systems to store and curate phenotypic data, and tools to manage trait meta data. The community has also begun developing BrAPI compatible tools for managing images and other high throughput phenotyping techniques. 
Phenotyping is crucial for implementing plant breeding methodologies and understanding their underlying concepts. Further studies, such as data analysis or genomic studies like genomic selection and marker selection (GWAS), are impossible without precise and accurate phenotyping. Phenotyping goes beyond merely collecting data; it involves comprehending the research question and devising a strategy to gather data that ensures successful research outcomes. The process involves measuring and analyzing observable plant characteristics, ranging from morphological and physiological traits to biochemical and molecular markers. Effective phenotyping can either ruin or enhance an entire research project. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the fundamental structure and techniques of phenotyping to conduct it effectively.
