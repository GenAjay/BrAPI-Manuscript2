#### Flapjack

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
[Flapjack](https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/flapjack) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq580] is a multi-platform desktop application for data visualization and breeding analysis (eg, pedigree verification, marker-assisted backcrossing and forward breeding) using high-throughput genotype data. Data can be easily imported into Flapjack from any BrAPI compatible data source with genotype data available. [Flapjack Bytes](https://github.com/cropgeeks/flapjack-bytes) is a smaller, lightweight and fully web-based counterpart to Flapjack, which can be easily embedded into a database website to provide similar visualizations online. Traditionally supporting its own text-based data formats, Flapjack's use of BrAPI has streamlined the end-user experience for data import and work is underway to determine the best methods to exchange analysis results using future versions of the API.

#### Helium

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
Helium is a platform for reviewing and managing pedigree data. It is BrAPI enabled, so pedigree data can be viewed straight from a database. 

#### Tassel

I don't know much about Tassel or its BrAPI compliance. This is filler text for the layout of the manuscript.

#### Trait Selector BrAPP

(this part should better fit at the beginning of the section?)
BrAPPs are simple tools developed by the BrAPI community that are entirely reliant on BrAPI for their data requirements. This means a single BrAPI can be shared and used by many organizations, as long as those organizations have the standard BrAPI endpoints available.

Trait Selector BrAPP

The Trait Selector BrAPP is used to search and select useful traits, using a visual aid to help the user find exactly what they need. This BrAPP works with both breeding databases and genebanks. Breeding databases would need to only implement the trait, observation and observation variable calls, while genebanks would require trait, germplasm attribute and germplasm attribute value calls. So, BrAPI servers compliant with version 2 implementing any of these sets of calls would just need to follow the documented steps to create an SVG image of a plant of interest in order to use this BrAPP. CassavaBase and MGIS are two successful examples of the use of this BrAPP. (example screenshots coming + supplementary data: links to the git and the doc)


#### DArTView

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
DArTView is a desktop application for visualizing genotype variant data and looking for trends or correlations. It is newly BrAPI compatible and can use BrAPI as an input data source.

#### DivBrowse

DivBrowse is a BrAPI compatible tool for visualizing genotype variant data.
