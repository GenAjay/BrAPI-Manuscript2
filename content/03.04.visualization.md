#### Flapjack

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
[Flapjack](https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/flapjack) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq580] is a multi-platform desktop application for data visualization and breeding analysis (eg, pedigree verification, marker-assisted backcrossing and forward breeding) using high-throughput genotype data. Data can be easily imported into Flapjack from any BrAPI compatible data source with genotype data available. [Flapjack Bytes](https://github.com/cropgeeks/flapjack-bytes) is a smaller, lightweight and fully web-based counterpart to Flapjack, which can be easily embedded into a database website to provide similar visualizations online. Traditionally supporting its own text-based data formats, Flapjack's use of BrAPI has streamlined the end-user experience for data import and work is underway to determine the best methods to exchange analysis results using future versions of the API.

#### Helium

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
Helium is a platform for reviewing and managing pedigree data. It is BrAPI enabled, so pedigree data can be viewed straight from a database. 

#### Tassel

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
I don't know much about Tassel or its BrAPI compliance. This is filler text for the layout of the manuscript.

#### Trait Selector BrAPP

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
BrAPPs are simple tools developed by the BrAPI community that are entirely reliant on BrAPI for their data requirements. This means a single BrAPI can be shared and used by many organizations, as long as those organizations have the standard BrAPI endpoints available. For example, the Trait Selector BrAPP is used to search and select useful traits, using a visual aid to help the user find exactly what they need. The BrAPP relies only on the BrAPI Trait endpoints to function, so any data resources with a the Trait endpoints available can add this tool to their system.

#### DArTView

<!-- Peter S: Stub paragraph to stimulate the writing process. Please edit, rewrite, or delete as needed. -->
DArTView is a desktop application for visualizing genotype variant data and looking for trends or correlations. It is newly BrAPI compatible and can use BrAPI as an input data source.

#### DivBrowse

DivBrowse [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giad025] is a web platform for exploratory data analysis of huge genotyping studies. The software can be run standalone or integrated as a plugin into existing data web portals. It provides a powerful interactive visualization of variant call matrices with hundreds of millions of variants and thousands of samples and enables easy data import and export by using standardized and established bioinformatics file formats. 
At its core, DivBrowse combines the convenience of a genome browser and adds features tailored to the diversity analysis of germplasm. It is able to display genomic features such as nucleotide sequence, associated gene models and short genomic variants. DivBrowse provides visual access to large VCF files obtained through genotyping experiments. In addition to visualizing variant calls per variant and genotype, DivBrowse also calculates and displays variant statistics such as minor allele frequencies, proportion of heterozygous calls or missing variant calls for each visualized genomic window. In addition, dynamic Principal Component Analyses (PCAs) can be performed on a user specified genomic area to provide information on local genomic diversity. 
DivBrowse has a Javascript API to control the tool from a hosting web portal (e.g. to control the list of genotypes to be displayed and the reference genome). DivBrowse has an interface to BLAST, which can be used to directly access genes or other genomic features. The modular structure of DivBrowse also allows developers to configure and easily embed links to external information systems. Furthermore, parts of BrAPI are implemented to provide genotypic data via its server-side component and is also able to consume and visualize genotypic data via an external BrAPI endpoint through the client-side GUI.
