#### BMS

The [Breeding Management System (BMS)](https://bmspro.io), developed by the [Integrated Breeding Platform (IBP)](https://integratedbreeding.net/), is a suite of tools designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of plant breeding. BMS covers all stages of the breeding process, with the emphasis on germplasm management and [ontology](https://cropontology.org)-harmonized phenotyping. It also features analytics and decision-support tools. With its focus on interoperability, BMS integrates smoothly with BrAPI, facilitating easy connections with a broad array of complementary tools and databases, notably [Gigwa](https://southgreen.fr/content/gigwa) which is deployed together with the BMS to fulfill the genotyping data management needs of BMS users.

The [brapi-sync](https://github.com/IntegratedBreedingPlatform/brapi-sync) tool, a significant component of BMSâ€™s BrAPI capabilities, was developed by the IBP and released as a BrAPP for community use. Brapi-sync is designed to enhance collaboration among partner institutes within a network such as Innovation and Plant Breeding in West Africa ([IAVAO](https://www.iavao.org/en)), by enabling the sharing of germplasm and trials across BrAPI-enabled systems. This tool helps overcome traditional barriers to collaboration, ensuring data that was once isolated within specific programs or platforms can now be easily shared, integrated, and synchronized. 

Additionally, brapi-sync improves data management by utilizing the externalReferences field to maintain links to the origin IDs of each entity it transmits. This not only retains the original context of the data but also establishes a traceability mechanism for accurate data source attribution and verification. Such practices are crucial for maintaining data integrity and fostering trust among collaborative partners, ensuring access to accurate, reliable, and current information.
