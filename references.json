Being able to access and share this data in standard formats is essential. The adoption of a common informatics platform for crops that may have limited resources brings economies of scale, allowing common informatics components to be used across multiple species. The close integration of such a platform with commonly used breeding software, visualization, and analysis tools reduces the barrier for entry to researchers and provides a common framework to facilitate collaborations and data sharing. This work presents significant updates to the Germinate platform and highlights its value in distributing prebreeding data for 14 crops as part of the project ‘Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting and Preparing Crop Wild Relatives’ (hereafter Crop Trust Crop Wild Relatives project) led by the Crop Trust (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"https://www.cwrdiversity.org\">https://www.cwrdiversity.org</jats:ext-link>). The addition of data on these species compliments data already publicly available in Germinate. We present a suite of updated Germinate features using examples from these crop species and their wild relatives. The use of Germinate within the Crop Trust Crop Wild Relatives project demonstrates the usefulness of the system and the benefits a shared informatics platform provides. These data resources provide a foundation on which breeding and research communities can develop additional online resources for their crops, harness new data as it becomes available, and benefit collectively from future developments of the Germinate platform.</jats:p>",

Increasing the use of germplasm conserved in genebanks is crucial. However, the lack of or difficult access to genetic diversity information limits the efficient utilization of these valuable resources. Here, we present a digital catalog of high‐density markers for banana germplasm conserved at the international banana collection. By facilitating access to subsets of genetic diversity information, the catalog has potential to maximize conservation and use of climate‐ready varieties and to optimize breeding strategies. The catalog is extendable with data from any banana collection and the software is easily deployable in other crop genebanks.</jats:p>",

Development of such a standard is recognized as critical to a number of important large breeding system initiatives as a foundational technology. The focus of the first version of the API is on providing services for connecting systems and retrieving basic breeding data including germplasm, study, observation, and marker data.

This necessitates access to efficient management systems to keep track of cross, performance, pedigree, geographical and image-based data, as well as genotyping data. In this article, we report the progress on the Breeding Information Management System (BIMS), a free, secure and online breeding management system that allows breeders to store, manage, archive and analyze their private breeding data. BIMS is the first publicly available database system that enables individual breeders to integrate their private phenotypic and genotypic data with public data and, at the same time, have complete control of their own breeding data along with access to tools such as data import/export, data analysis and data archiving. The integration of breeding data with publicly available genomic and genetic data enhances genetic understanding of important traits and maximizes the marker-assisted breeding utility for breeders and allied scientists. BIMS incorporates the use of the Android App Field Book, open-source phenotype data collection software for phones and tablets that allows breeders to replace hard copy field books, thus alleviating the possibility of transcription errors while providing faster access to the collected data. BIMS comes with training materials and support for individual or small group training and is currently implemented in the Genome Database for Rosaceae, CottonGEN, the Citrus Genome Database, the Pulse Crop Database, and the Genome Database for Vaccinium.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Database URLs: (https://www.rosaceae.org/), (https://www.cottongen.org/), (https://www.citrusgenomedb.org/), (https://www.pulsedb.org/) and (https://www.vaccinium.org/)</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last eight years, the volume of whole genome, gene expression, SNP genotyping, and phenotype data generated by the cotton research community has exponentially increased. The efficient utilization/re-utilization of these complex and large datasets for knowledge discovery, translation, and application in crop improvement requires them to be curated, integrated with other types of data, and made available for access and analysis through efficient online search tools. Initiated in 2012, CottonGen is an online community database providing access to integrated peer-reviewed cotton genomic, genetic, and breeding data, and analysis tools. Used by cotton researchers worldwide, and managed by experts with crop-specific knowledge, it continuous to be the logical choice to integrate new data and provide necessary interfaces for information retrieval. The repository in CottonGen contains colleague, gene, genome, genotype, germplasm, map, marker, metabolite, phenotype, publication, QTL, species, transcriptome, and trait data curated by the CottonGen team. The number of data entries housed in CottonGen has increased dramatically, for example, since 2014 there has been an 18-fold increase in genes/mRNAs, a 23-fold increase in whole genomes, and a 372-fold increase in genotype data. New tools include a genetic map viewer, a genome browser, a synteny viewer, a metabolite pathways browser, sequence retrieval, BLAST, and a breeding information management system (BIMS), as well as various search pages for new data types. CottonGen serves as the home to the International Cotton Genome Initiative, managing its elections and serving as a communication and coordination hub for the community. With its extensive curation and integration of data and online tools, CottonGen will continue to facilitate utilization of its critical resources to empower research for cotton crop improvement.</jats:p>",

Their reanalysis requires tracing relevant information on thousands of plants, sensors and events.\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  \r\n                    The open‐source Phenotyping Hybrid Information System (\r\n                    PHIS\r\n                    ) is proposed for plant phenotyping experiments in various categories of installations (field, glasshouse). It unambiguously identifies all objects and traits in an experiment and establishes their relations via ontologies and semantics that apply to both field and controlled conditions. For instance, the genotype is declared for a plant or plot and is associated with all objects related to it. Events such as successive plant positions, anomalies and annotations are associated with objects so they can be easily retrieved.\r\n                  \r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  Its ontology‐driven architecture is a powerful tool for integrating and managing data from multiple experiments and platforms, for creating relationships between objects and enriching datasets with knowledge and metadata. It interoperates with external resources via web services, thereby allowing data integration into other systems; for example, modelling platforms or external databases.\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  It has the potential for rapid diffusion because of its ability to integrate, manage and visualize multi‐source and multi‐scale data, but also because it is based on 10 yr of trial and error in our groups.",

This is particularly challenging in the plant phenotyping domain, due to its complexity and heterogeneity.\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  We have produced the MIAPPE 1.1 release, which enhances the existing MIAPPE standard in coverage, to support perennial plants, in structure, through an explicit data model, and in clarity, through definitions and examples.\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  We evaluated MIAPPE 1.1 by using it to express several heterogeneous phenotyping experiments in a range of different formats, to demonstrate its applicability and the interoperability between the various implementations. Furthermore, the extended coverage is demonstrated by the fact that one of the datasets could not have been described under MIAPPE 1.0.\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                  MIAPPE 1.1 marks a major step towards enabling plant phenotyping data reusability, thanks to its extended coverage, and especially the formalisation of its data model, which facilitates its implementation in different formats. Community feedback has been critical to this development, and will be a key part of ensuring adoption of the standard.",
