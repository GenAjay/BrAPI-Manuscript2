Recently, the size and complexity of datasets have increased significantly, with the result that data are often stored on multiple systems. As analyses of interest increasingly require aggregation of datasets from diverse sources, data exchange between disparate systems becomes a challenge.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>To facilitate interoperability among breeding applications, we present the public plant Breeding Application Programming Interface (BrAPI). BrAPI is a standardized web service API specification. The development of BrAPI is a collaborative, community-based initiative involving a growing global community of over a hundred participants representing several dozen institutions and companies. Development of such a standard is recognized as critical to a number of important large breeding system initiatives as a foundational technology. The focus of the first version of the API is on providing services for connecting systems and retrieving basic breeding data including germplasm, study, observation, and marker data. A number of BrAPI-enabled applications, termed BrAPPs, have been written, that take advantage of the emerging support of BrAPI by many databases.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>More information on BrAPI, including links to the specification, test suites, BrAPPs, and sample implementations is available at https://brapi.org/.

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In this era of big data, breeding programs are producing ever larger amounts of data. This necessitates access to efficient management systems to keep track of cross, performance, pedigree, geographical and image-based data, as well as genotyping data. In this article, we report the progress on the Breeding Information Management System (BIMS), a free, secure and online breeding management system that allows breeders to store, manage, archive and analyze their private breeding data. BIMS is the first publicly available database system that enables individual breeders to integrate their private phenotypic and genotypic data with public data and, at the same time, have complete control of their own breeding data along with access to tools such as data import/export, data analysis and data archiving. The integration of breeding data with publicly available genomic and genetic data enhances genetic understanding of important traits and maximizes the marker-assisted breeding utility for breeders and allied scientists. BIMS incorporates the use of the Android App Field Book, open-source phenotype data collection software for phones and tablets that allows breeders to replace hard copy field books, thus alleviating the possibility of transcription errors while providing faster access to the collected data. BIMS comes with training materials and support for individual or small group training and is currently implemented in the Genome Database for Rosaceae, CottonGEN, the Citrus Genome Database, the Pulse Crop Database, and the Genome Database for Vaccinium.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Database URLs: (https://www.rosaceae.org/), (https://www.cottongen.org/), (https://www.citrusgenomedb.org/), (https://www.pulsedb.org/) and (https://www.vaccinium.org/)</jats:p>",

The efficient utilization/re-utilization of these complex and large datasets for knowledge discovery, translation, and application in crop improvement requires them to be curated, integrated with other types of data, and made available for access and analysis through efficient online search tools. Initiated in 2012, CottonGen is an online community database providing access to integrated peer-reviewed cotton genomic, genetic, and breeding data, and analysis tools. Used by cotton researchers worldwide, and managed by experts with crop-specific knowledge, it continuous to be the logical choice to integrate new data and provide necessary interfaces for information retrieval. The repository in CottonGen contains colleague, gene, genome, genotype, germplasm, map, marker, metabolite, phenotype, publication, QTL, species, transcriptome, and trait data curated by the CottonGen team. The number of data entries housed in CottonGen has increased dramatically, for example, since 2014 there has been an 18-fold increase in genes/mRNAs, a 23-fold increase in whole genomes, and a 372-fold increase in genotype data. New tools include a genetic map viewer, a genome browser, a synteny viewer, a metabolite pathways browser, sequence retrieval, BLAST, and a breeding information management system (BIMS), as well as various search pages for new data types. CottonGen serves as the home to the International Cotton Genome Initiative, managing its elections and serving as a communication and coordination hub for the community. With its extensive curation and integration of data and online tools, CottonGen will continue to facilitate utilization of its critical resources to empower research for cotton crop improvement.</jats:p>",
